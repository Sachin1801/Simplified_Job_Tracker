# Job Application Tracker

A simple and intuitive tool built with **Python** and **Streamlit** that lets you track, update, and manage your job applications. The app uses Google Sheets as a backend data store so that your data is always in sync, and it features Google OAuth-based authentication to secure your information.

## Features

- **Add Applications:** Input new job applications with details such as:
  - Company Name
  - One or more Job Links

  - Application Status (e.g. "Applied", "Positive Response received", "Rejected")
  
- **Search & Filter:** 
  - Search for applications by company name with real-time suggestions.
  - Filter applications by the date they were applied.
  
- **View & Update:**

- **Pre-written Messages:** For each application, the app displays pre-generated messages that you can use to send connection requests or approach recruiters.

- **Google Sheets Integration:** 
  - The app stores and updates your job application data in a Google Sheet named `job-tracker`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sachin1801-simplified_job_tracker.git
cd sachin1801-simplified_job_tracker
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate on macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

## Google Authentication Setup

1. **Create Google OAuth Credentials:**

   - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project (or select an existing one).
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click **Create Credentials** and choose **OAuth client ID**.
   - Set the application type to **Web application**.
   - Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add:  
     `http://localhost:8501`
   - Download the JSON file and save it as `client_secret.json` in the root directory of your project.

2. **Configure Scopes:**

   The file [`constants/constants.py`](./constants/constants.py) contains the following scopes:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`
   
   These scopes allow the app to read, write, and manage your job tracker Google Sheet.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   Start the Streamlit app by running:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Authentication:**

   - On first launch, you will be prompted to log in with your Google account.
   - Click the **"Login with Google ðŸ”‘"** button to authorize.
   - Upon successful authentication, your credentials will be cached locally (in `.auth_cache`) and stored in your session.

3. **Navigating the App:**

   - **Add Application:** Use the form to input new job application details.
   - **Search by Company:** Type in a company name to see suggestions and view matching applications.
   - **Filter by Date:** Select a date to view all applications submitted on that day.
   - **View All Applications:** See an overview of all job applications and update details as needed.

4. **Updating Applications:**

   - When viewing an application, you can add new job links or update the connection and application status using the provided options.
   - Pre-generated messages are displayed if the connection status is set to "Connection request pending."

## Development Details

- **Authentication Module (`auth/auth.py`):**  
  Handles the OAuth flow using the Google Auth libraries. It manages session state and caches credentials locally.

- **Google Sheets Integration (`job_tracker/sheets.py`):**  
  Uses the `gspread` library to interact with Google Sheets. It includes functions to load the data into a Pandas DataFrame and to save updates back to the sheet.

- **User Interface (`job_tracker/pages.py`):**  
  Contains the Streamlit pages for various functionalities (adding, searching, filtering, viewing, and updating applications).

- **Utility Functions (`job_tracker/utils.py`):**  
  Provides helper functions for generating connection request and recruiter messages tailored for the company.

- **Constants (`constants/constants.py`):**  
  Stores global constants such as OAuth scopes, the client secrets file location, and pre-defined options for connection and application statuses.
